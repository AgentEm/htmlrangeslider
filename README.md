htmlrangeslider
===============

A slider made using input type=range, CSS, and jQuery without jQuery UI

*NOTE*: A work in progress, currently only confirmed support for Chrome and Safari desktop, and Safari mobile. 
Total mess on moz because I got lazy with the vendor prefixes. Will keep updating to perfection.

This slider is completely responsive, styling is easy to customize, and done completely without relying on anything other than jQuery, CSS3 and HTML5.
