Things I need the slider to do still:

1. Snap to each step, but also animate that so that it snaps smoothly
2. If possible: always have the center of the ball be on the center of the label. If not the approximation I currently have is good enough
3. Fill in the slider div behind the ball and make the width of the div be the correct size <<<<DONEish


Functionality 
- click on ball, drag to label, ball snaps to label/step
- click on step area, ball snaps to closest label/step
- orange fill div resizes with the ball while dragging, both backwards and forwards

so first ball needs to be draggable, so should you make the steps small and then make it snap to closest say multiple of 10?
FIRST you have to make it so that it CAN go backwards!
